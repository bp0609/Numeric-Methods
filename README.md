# Numeric-Methods
Numerical methods, also known as numerical analysis, are mathematical techniques used to solve complex mathematical problems or perform computations with numerical data. These methods involve approximating solutions to mathematical problems when exact analytical solutions are difficult or impossible to obtain. They rely on algorithms and computational techniques to perform calculations. These algorithms often involve iterative processes to refine approximations until a satisfactory result is achieved.

Numerical methods are essential tools for solving mathematical problems in practical, real-world situations, where analytical solutions are not always feasible or efficient. 

This Repo contains some of the common numeric methods with python code and a report of detail explanation to solve paticular types of complex mathematical equations that any engineer faces in re
